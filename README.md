# Interactive Novel – Master’s Thesis Project

This repository contains the thesis project developed for the **Advanced Master in Digital Humanities** at KU Leuven.

The project is an interactive novel built with Ren'Py, combining narrative design with data-driven storytelling. During the story, external data are dynamically extracted from a structured dataset and integrated into the narrative flow.

## Project Overview

The interactive novel explores the relationship between narrative choice and structured data. Instead of relying solely on hard-coded story variables, the project uses an external database to influence story events, dialogue, and narrative outcomes.


## Repository Structure

The repository contains two main files:

- Python file
  This file contains the Ren'Py-compatible Python code that defines the story structure, narrative logic, and interactions.

- Excel file (.xlsx)  
  This file functions as a database. It stores structured data that is read and processed during the execution of the story.
